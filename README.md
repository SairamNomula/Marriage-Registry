## The Problem it solves
Storing the marriage details and certificates shouldn't be compromised because of natural calamities, hackers, centralized server crashes. We addressed this issue with Solana Blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into
We were unable to understand writing smart contracts using Rust programming language on top of Solana Blockchain. We were getting errors when we were compiling the code itself. 

## Technologies we used
 * Solana
 * Rust
 * Smart contracts
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Web3
